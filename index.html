                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast with a deep passion for protecting systems, uncovering threats, and responding to incidents. My aspirations are to specialize in Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR), where I combine investigative thinking with technical skills to identify, analyze, and neutralize security breaches. I’m driven by curiosity and precision. Whether it’s digging into logs, tracing attack vectors, or strengthening defenses, I’m motivated by my passion for solving cases and the pursuit of the truth.

                    <h3>Network Penetration Test Engagement</h3>
                    <p>Conducted an internal penetration test as a volunteer for an organization, focusing on the effectiveness of network segmentation and access controls. Evaluated traffic restrictions between VLANs, attempted lateral movement across zones, and identified potential misconfigurations. Delivered a comprehensive findings report with actionable remediation steps to enhance segmentation security and limit attack surface.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="project">
                    <h3>SOC Analyst Training & Onboarding Program</h3>
                    <p>Developed and delivered a Security Operations Center (SOC) training program for 10 students, covering core SOC functions, key concepts, alert triage, incident response, and tool usage. The program reduced analyst onboarding time by over 3 months, improving operational readiness and accelerating integration of new talent into live SOC environments.</p>

                <div class="project">
                    <h3>Multi-Zone Network Security Environment</h3>
                    <p>Designed and deployed a miniature enterprise-grade network with 5 hosts, 2 webservers, and layered security infrastructure. Integrated Palo Alto and Fortigate firewalls with RADIUS authentication and DUO MFA, implemented VPN access, and structured network segmentation into DMZ, Inside, and Secure zones. Built centralized visibility using Splunk and Security Onion SIEMs for comprehensive log collection, monitoring, and threat detection.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="project">
                    <h3>PowerShell IP Discovery (Windows & Linux)</h3>
                    <p>Created a system-agnostic PowerShell script leveraging classes to enumerate local IP addresses on Windows and Linux. The script accepts arguments (IPv4, IPv6, or Both, defaulting to Both) and returns addresses as an array, enabling seamless use in automation pipelines or integration with other scripts.</p>
